README

This is an old project of mine, worked on between 2019-2021. Any future updates will be to fix serious bugs. I have no intention in working further on this project.
Please see the old README below. V


Hello! Welcome to this Danganronpa Simulator, coded in Python! I did not program the original code however it was given to me in 2019 after the original programmer gave up on the project and no longer wanted part in it. I have been working on finishing the project since then. EDIT: I'm aware they've started to remake their program since they gave it to me, but I'm proceeding with the fact that I still own rights to THIS simulator.

Unfortunately, you can only see updates from 2021 below as I didn't write down any updates prior to that.

In regards to presets, they will remain as the official games of the Danganronpa series. However, I may also consider making extra presets for limited times only, perhaps for promotion purposes, not sure. Again, consideration. If this is something that piques your curiosity, let me know.





VVV Issues & Updates VVV




    ISSUES I AM AWARE OF / THINGS I WANT TO ADD

* I wish to add a voting system, so players can see who everyone in the cast votes.
* I wish to add more random names/talents.
* I wish to make the program more robust by making it impossible to break.
* I wish to add the option to alter the number of cast.
* At some point in the future, I wish to rewrite the code or create a new program based off of the current one so it can be written much neater and so it is easier to maintain and update, as it currently is a headache and updating and fixing bugs can take a long time. As it is so hard, it is unlikely there will be any major developments until this is complete. This will likely not be finished until Summer 2021 due to college and other projects which MUST take priority. If anyone still uses this sim, please wait for then!
* In the far future, I may consider remaking the code on an environment such as Unity so it can have some graphics and be more user friendly to people who do not want to look at text all day!

Progress on Danganronpa Simulator V2 has now begun! It is not expected to be complete for a while and so there will be no new updates on this simulator. 


    05/01/2021
The program now identifies who the mastermind is when there is no uprising in Chapter 6 and the remaining students vote hope. This was due to an error where the variable containing the mastermind's identity was not given.

I have restarted work on this program after a year of letting it sit and fester! ^^
Old presets that are not part of the official Danganronpa series have been removed.
Instead of a 4/5 chance of having an uprising during Chpater 6, there is now a 9/10 chance, making uprisings more common. This means there is a 1/10 chance of no uprising and the game continuing.
